## About the Project
This project focuses on building a secure authentication and key agreement system for peer-to-peer (P2P) cloud environments.  
It uses anonymous identity-based cryptography to protect user privacy while ensuring secure communication.  
By combining **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** and **Secure Remote Password (SRP)**, the system enables secure key exchange without exposing real user identities.  

---

## How it Works
Each peer generates an anonymous identity.  
When two peers connect:  
1. They perform mutual authentication using SRP.  
2. A session key is established with ECC-based key exchange.  
3. The session key is used to encrypt communication (**AES-GCM**).  

Supabase provides:  
- **Auth** ‚Üí for identity management.  
- **Realtime** ‚Üí for peer-to-peer signaling.  
- **Postgres** ‚Üí for storing encrypted metadata.  
- **REST APIs** ‚Üí for secure interaction between frontend and backend.

## Tech Stack
| Component | Usage |
|-----------|-------|
| React.js | Frontend interface for users/peers. |
| Supabase Auth | Authentication & anonymous identity management. |
| Supabase Realtime | Peer-to-peer communication channel for key exchange. |
| Supabase Postgres | Stores metadata and encrypted session data. |
| Supabase REST APIs | Secure communication between frontend & backend. |
| ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) | Lightweight cryptography for key exchange. |
| SRP (Secure Remote Password) | Password-authenticated key agreement. |
| AES-GCM | Session encryption after key establishment. |
| Node.js (optional) | Middleware for advanced crypto operations. |

---

## Expected Outcomes
- Secure authentication in P2P cloud systems.  
- Anonymous identity support for enhanced privacy.  
- Lightweight & efficient cryptographic operations compared to PKI.  
- Scalable for IoT, multi-cloud, and blockchain-based environments.  

---

## Future Scope
- Extend support for multi-cloud environments.  
- Integrate with blockchain for auditability and trust.  
- Optimize for IoT devices with limited resources.  

---

## Project Status
Currently in **initial phase** ‚Üí Requirement gathering, system design, and stack selection.  
Implementation will focus on **Supabase + ECC + SRP** integration.

## Abstract
Peer-to-peer (P2P) cloud systems offer scalability and decentralization but face challenges in secure and private communication.  
This work presents a lightweight authentication and key agreement protocol using **anonymous identities** and **elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)**.  
The scheme enables **mutual authentication** and **secure session key establishment** without revealing real identities, ensuring **confidentiality, integrity, and resistance** to replay, impersonation, and man-in-the-middle attacks.  
Its efficiency makes it suitable for dynamic, resource-constrained P2P cloud environments.

## Proposed Tech Stack
| Technology / Library | Purpose in Project | Why it is Used |
|----------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| React.js (Frontend) | User Interface for authentication, identity creation, and peer-to-peer session initiation. | Lightweight, fast, widely adopted, great for UI. |
| Supabase Auth | User authentication & identity management. | Serverless auth (email, passwordless, OAuth), supports anonymous identity. |
| Supabase Realtime | Peer-to-peer communication channel. | Low-latency sync between peers. |
| Supabase Postgres | Stores encrypted identities, tokens, metadata. | PostgreSQL + RLS for secure storage. |
| Supabase REST APIs | Secure backend interaction. | Exposes endpoints for session initiation & verification. |
| ECC (JS Library) | Cryptographic key generation & exchange. | Lightweight, secure, better than RSA for cloud. |
| SRP (JS Library) | Password-authenticated key exchange. | Zero-knowledge proof, protects against eavesdropping & replay. |
| AES-GCM (Crypto API) | Session encryption. | Authenticated encryption for secure comms. |
| Node.js (Optional Middleware) | Extra cryptographic logic. | Used if Supabase can‚Äôt handle certain crypto ops. |
| Cloud Deployment (Supabase/Vercel/Netlify) | Hosting. | Realistic deployment for cloud-native project. |
