## Abstract

Peer-to-peer (P2P) cloud systems offer scalability and decentralization but face
challenges in secure and private communication. This work presents a
lightweight authentication and key agreement protocol using anonymous
identities and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). The scheme enables mutual
authentication and secure session key establishment without revealing real
identities, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and resistance to replay,
impersonation, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Its efficiency makes it suitable
for dynamic, resource-constrained P2P cloud environments, enhancing both
privacy and trustworthiness in distributed data sharing.
